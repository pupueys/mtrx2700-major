// Functions

void enable_wire_interrupts();
// Enable interrupts on falling edge for PE4â€“PE9
// Input - NA
// Output - Call the respective interrupt handler when wire is pulled

void handle_wire_pull(int wire_index);
// Called when interrupt is happened, updates the game variables and checks if game is over
// Input - The index of the wire that is pulled based on the handler called
// Output - Updates the state of the game variables and end game is end condition is true

void end_game(int end_of_game);
// End the game and based on the input see if the player won or not
// Input - Flag indicating win or lose
// Output - open the doors or turn the buzzer on based on the input flag
